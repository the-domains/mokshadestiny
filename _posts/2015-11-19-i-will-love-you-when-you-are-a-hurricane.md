_by Clementine von Radics_

I am not the first person you loved.You are not the first person I looked atwith a mouthful of forevers.

We have both known loss like the sharp edgesof a knife. We have both lived with lipsmore scar tissue than skin. Our love cameunannounced in the middle of the night.

Our love came when we'd given upon asking love to come. I thinkthat has to be partof its miracle.

This is how we heal.

I will kiss you like forgiveness. Youwill hold me like I'm hope. Our armswill bandage and we will press promisesbetween us like flowers in a book.

I will write sonnets to the salt of sweaton your skin. I will write novels to the scarof your nose. I will write a dictionaryof all the words I have used tryingto describe the way it feels to have finally,finally found you.

And I will not be afraidof your scars.

I know sometimesit's still hard to let me see youin all your cracked perfection,but please know:

whether it's the days you burnmore brilliant than the sunor the nights you collapse into my lapyour body broken into a thousand questions,you are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

**I will love you when you are a still day.I will love you when you are a hurricane.**
